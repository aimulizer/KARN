                KARN is an initiative by the students of Bharati Vidyapeeth's 
                college of Engineering to assist the folks in dire need of our 
                help. We as an earthborn have one single purpose in life, to 
                help the unfortunate and make their lives worth living.
                <br>
                <br>
                Working towards this ideology we have defined our first manifesto
                this winter. So let us provide a soulder for those in need and bring
                the planet one step closer to the distant utopian world we all envision.
                And remember there is no exceercise better for heart than reaching down 
                and lifting people up.
